1. Create a dictionary with the following values: first_name=Richard,
last_name=Feynman, favourite_number=17 and occupation=physicist.
In further steps do the following:

1) Add another element to the dictionary called 'unique_id' and assign it the
    value 23764
2) Update the key-value-pair favourite_number to its previous value + 10
3) Remove the key-value-pair of last_name from the dictionary
4) Print all keys in the dictionary and the print all values in the dictionary
5) Check whether the keys "occupation" and "age" are in the keys of the dictionary

2. Concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one:

dic2={3:30, 4:40}

Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

3. Create a function that takes the parameters (1) length (2) lower_bound and (3)
upper_bound and that then returns a list of the length specified with random
numbers between the lower_bound and the upper_bound

"""
4. Use your previously created function to generate a list of length 1000 with
lower_bound = 0 and upper_bound = 42. Then sort this list and print the first,
the 500th and the last element respectively

5. Use your previously created function to generate a list of length 1000 with
lower_bound = 0 and upper_bound = 50. Then loop over the list until the program
finds the number '42'. If it finds it then print "Found number 42" and exit the
loop, so that it does not continue searching. In either case, print "finished
search" when the loop has finished without finding a 42 in it or if finding it

"""
6. Again, use your previously created function to generate a list. This time of
length 10000 with lower_bound = 0 and upper_bound = 50. Can you find a method
that will return us with the first instance of the number 42 it finds in this
list? Check your result, print the number by accessing the list at the position
you find

7. Write a function that takes a users name as an input and then prints "hello
[users name]" using that name
"""

"""
8. Write a function called 'odd_even' that takes one input parameter and prints out
whether the number is even or odd
"""
# your code



"""
9. Write a function that goes through all the numbers of from input1 and input2
and prints out all the multiples between 3 and 7. E.g. if input1=0 and input2=25
the the output should be 3,6,7,9,12,14,15,18,21,24

"""
10. Modify your function created in the last exercise such that instead of printing
the numbers, the function returns two arrays with the multiples of 3 and 7
respectively
E.g. [3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24] and [7,14,21] for input1=0 and input2=25
