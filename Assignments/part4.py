In the following script you will work with the flask package. The
questions should stay grouped at the top of the script as you wont be able to
dynamically run your code line by line, but will have to execute the entire
script

1. Create a basic flask app with one route an make sure that you can run it
on your computer

2. add a second route called "university" that redirects to the homepage of
our university (https://www.unisg.ch/en)

3. add a third route called 'myhtml' that renders a basic html file. You can
just copy and paste the html part from here:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp

4. add a link to your 'myhtml' route that links your users to your first page
you can look up how to insert a link into a html website here:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp

5. In your first route call the weather api from part3 and show the weather
Zurich through any type of localisation (lat. long., city name, id etc.) of
your choice


*** Bonus questions ***
these questions are not required to achieve a full score (i.e. a 6.0) but you
can use them to either compensate for other questions or because (hopefully)
youre interested

bonus question 1: (3 points)
Create a new route called 'form' and create your own form taking as an input
fields the features that you were using in your regression in part 2. Test
whether your form can be submitted by just printing out the input fields
tipp: you have to make a small modification to your print function as it wont
print to the same location as normal while running flask:

bonus question 2:
create another field in your form being rendered in the 'form' route that
dynamically adopts the value that was entered in the first form field once
the form is submitted

bonus question 3: (2 points)
load the wine regression model you created in the last exercise group and insert
and use it to output predictions about a wines quality. Insert it into the
function of the 'form route', take the form fields as input, an show the result
in the dynamic field you created in the last question
